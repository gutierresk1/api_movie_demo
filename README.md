# api_movie_demo

by Kristian Gutierres

This one of the projects thst I have made using Android Studio. It's purpose was to emulate a database that
dynamically populates data with multiple tabs that have different tasks. Most of it is still in a working progess, 
as I want to add session variables onto the last tab. 

The app is coded with JAVA.
